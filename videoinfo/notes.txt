HTML
- can get details about files that a user purposefully feeds into it

Electron
- can read any arbitrary file off the machine at any time

Electron app should hold:
- specific configuration and logic

Web app should:
- be kept as generic as possible to
- increase possible reuse on plain web

Steps in communication process:
1. send info to electron from main window
ipcRenderer.send('video:submit', path);

2. receive info into Electron
- 'video:submit' must match the first arg of ipcRenderer.send
ipcMain.on

3. send info from electron to main window
4. receive info into main window
